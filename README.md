# angular6-contact-book

A simple **contact book** created using Angular6 (frontend) and loopback (backend). By the end of this tutorial project you will have basic knowledge of below technologies:
- Loopback
- Testing APIs using Mocha, chai and chai-http
- Angular 6


# Running Project
***

## Install dependencies

  - **Install Loopback dependencies:**  Inside project root fodler `/angular6-contact-book`, run below cmd
    ```
    npm install
    ```

     > NOTE: It will take some time to download all the required dependencies, wait for it to finish.

  - **Install Angular dependencies :** Inside Angular root folder `/angular6-contact-book/client`, run below cmd
    ```
    npm install
    ```


There are 2 modes for running the project.
  - Development Mode
  - Production Mode

## Development mode

#### Start Loopback Server
Go to project root folder i.e. `/angular6-contact-book` and Start loopback server using,
```
npm start
```

you will get to see below message when server is up,
```
Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000
Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorer
```

To run Loopback server just copy-paste below URL in your browser
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

> But you won't be able to see anything as we are runnig development mode and there are angular static files as of now which loopback can serve.

To run Loopback API explorer just copy-paste below URL in your browser
```
http://localhost:3000/explorer
```


#### Start Angular
Go to project Angular folder i.e. `/angular6-contact-book/client` and Start Angular server using,
```
npm start
```

you will get to see below message when server is up,
```
ℹ ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.
```

To run Angular app just copy-paste below URL in your browser
```
http://localhost:4200
```


## Production Mode
To run project in prod mode i.e. make loopback server to serve angular app.
1. Build your angular app to generate static content for loopback.
    - Go to Angular folder i.e. `/angular6-contact-book/client`
    - Run build cmd
        ```
        ng build
        ```
    - Once build is done, you will get to see `angular6-contact-book/client/dist` is generated.
1. Now simply run loopback server,
   ```
   npm start
    ```

Now both Loopbak and Angular runs at `http://localhost:3000`


# Running Backend Test
***
Make sure you have downloaded all the needed dependencies, if not then go to project root folder `angular6-contact-book` and run below cmd
```
npm install
```

Running Api test is very easy, as we have already setup **npm script** so all you need to do is just go to Project root
`angular6-contact-book` and run below cmd
```
npm test
```


# Tutorial
