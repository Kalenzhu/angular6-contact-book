## Installing loopback CLI
```ssh
npm install -g loopback-cli
```

## Create new Loopback app
Create new app using CLI's `lb` command
Once you hit `lb` command you need to provide the details like project name, etc and loopback will generate app for you.


Below it shows how i used lb command in my terminal. For detailed step checkout [Loopback documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Create-a-simple-API.html#create-new-application)
```ssh
Varuns-MacBook-Air:angular6-contact-book varunsukheja$ lb
? What's the name of your application? angular6-contact-book
? Which version of LoopBack would you like to use? 3.x (current)
? What kind of application do you have in mind? api-server (A LoopBack API server with local User auth)
Generating .yo-rc.json
.
.
.
```

> NOTE: You can also create project using `slc` or `apic` but it is recommended to use `lb` with version 3.x of loopback, because slc and apic are legacy since v3.x.


## Create new Data Source
Loopback provides you to have various databases like
  - Memory
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
  - Elastic Search
  - Oracle
  and many more

> For creating data sources to connect to various databases checkout [loopback documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/Memory-connector.html#creating-a-data-source)

I am going to create a new data source named as **fileSystem** which will be a **In-memory db** and it will store all of its data in a json file to which I will name as **data.json**.

```ssh
Varuns-MacBook-Air:angular6-contact-book varunsukheja$ lb datasource
? Enter the datasource name: fileSystem
? Select the connector for fileSystem: In-memory db (supported by StrongLoop)
? window.localStorage key to use for persistence (browser only):
? Full path to file for persistence (server only): data.json
```

> Persisting data in file check [loopback documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/Memory-connector.html#data-persistence)


## Create new Data Model
I am going to create a new data model **Contact**, which will have below mentioned attributes

| Field         | Description      |
| ------------- |:---------------: |
| firstName     | First Name       |
| lastName      | Last Name        |
| phoneNumber   | Phone Number     |
| email         | Email            |
| isActive      | Status (Active/Inactive)|
| country       | Country (India)  |
| countryCode   | Country Code(+91)|

To create a data model we use cmd
```
$ lb model
```
