## Installing CLI
Let's start with installing Angular CLI which makes the task of angular app development too easy for us.

> NOTE: I am currently using node v10.3.0 and npm v6.1.0

```ssh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

> For more info on Angular CLI please check it [Official Site](https://cli.angular.io/)


## Creating new Angular6 app
With Angular CLI it is too easy to create a new app. All you need to do is just run `ng new` and give your app name.

```ssh
 ng new ngContactBook --style=scss --directory "client"
```

In above cmd,
- `ng new` is the CLI cmd to create new Angular project
- `ngContactBook` is the name of my Angular project.
- `--style=scss` tells the CLI that I want to use .scss for styling instead .css.
- `--directory "client"` tells the CLI that I don't want to create a new directory, instead use the existing **client** directory to put all the Angular files.


## Running your Angular project

To run your Angular app, just switch to the directory where your Angular app installed and run `npm serve --open`.
Since our project is installed in **client** folder, so we need to first switch current folder to be **client** and then serve the angular app using `ng serve --open`.

```ssh
cd client
ng serve --open
```
