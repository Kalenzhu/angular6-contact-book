## Installing Angular Material

To install angular material as mentioned in their [official doc](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started)
we need to install 2 packages **@angular/material** and **@angular/cdk**


```ssh
ng add @angular/material
ng add @angular/cdk
```


> NOTE: We are using `ng add` instead of `npm install` because ng add is the new functionality provided by angular6,
ng add will use your package manager to download new dependencies and invoke an installation script (implemented as a schematic) which can update your project with configuration changes, add additional dependencies (e.g. polyfills), or scaffold package-specific initialization code.
