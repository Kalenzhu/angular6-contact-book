## Installing libraries

#### Mocha

 **Mocha** is a JavaScript test framework for Node.js. For more details and documentation check its [Github repo](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
   To install mocha check below cmd:
   ```ssh
   npm install mocha --save-dev
   ```

#### Chai
 **Chai** is an assertion library, similar to Node's build in assert. It makes testing much easier by giving you lots of assertions you can run against your code.
 For more details and documentation check its [Github repo](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).
To install mocha check below cmd:
   ```ssh
   npm install chai --save-dev
   ```

#### Chai-http
 **Chai-http** is a js library which helps you make HTTP request using chai.
 For more details and documentation check its [Github repo](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-http).
To install mocha check below cmd:
   ```ssh
   npm install chai-http --save-dev
   ```


## Setting up Tests for APIs

### Creating new Data source for test

We are going to create a new data source for test so that testing does not impact the **Production Data**.

- Copy the **datasources.json** file under server folder and paste it under same folder and rename it as **datasources.test.json**.

- Open the **datasources.test.json** file and rename **data.json** to **test-data.json** mentioned in file field.

Before
```ssh
"fileSystem": {
    "name": "fileSystem",
    "localStorage": "",
    "file": "data/data.json",
    "connector": "memory"
  }
```

After
```ssh
"fileSystem": {
    "name": "fileSystem",
    "localStorage": "",
    "file": "data/test-data.json",
    "connector": "memory"
  }
```

Q. What's the use of creating **datasources.test.json** ?

Ans. Whenever we start loopback server after setting `NODE_ENV=test` our models will now use datasource mentioned in **datasources.test.json** instead of using datasources from **datasources.json**.
So the file path mentioned in **datasources.test.json** is *data/test-data.json*, hence our models will use *test-data.json* file instead of using *data.json*,
therefore our **production data** which is present in *data.json* will not be impacted while testing.



### Setting up test file
- Create a new tests folder and add a new  test file, lets call it as contact.test.js
- Now in test file lets set NODE_ENV to test so that when server starts it uses datasources.test.json instead of datasources.json
```ssh
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'test';
```
- Now import the dev dependencies,
```ssh
// Require the dev-dependencies
let chai = require('chai');
let chaiHttp = require('chai-http');
let server = require('../../server/server');
let should = chai.should();
chai.use(chaiHttp);
```
- Now we need to import the model that we want to test, in our case we have to test **Contact** model
```ssh
// Model to test
let Contact = require('../../common/models/contact');
```


### Writing test

After setting up test framework in  **contact.test.js** file, lets write our 1st test.

Create a describe block and it block as shown below

```ssh
describe('Contacts', () => {
  /*
  * Test the /GET route
  */
  describe('/GET contact', () => {
    it('it should GET all the contacts', (done) => {
      // test code goes here
    });
  });
});
```


Now inside the it block we can write our test to check get request
This is how it block looks after adding test,

```ssh
it('it should GET all the contacts', (done) => {
      chai.request(server)
        .get('/api/Contacts')
        .then(function(response) {
          response.should.have.status(200);
          done();
        })
        .catch(function(error) {
          done(error);
        });
    });
```

### Running test

Running the test is very simple just type mocha and give path to your test file.

```ssh
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha tests/contact.test.js
```

In above cmd, it will run only a single test which is **contact.test.js**
Now, in bigger project we might have more than one test file, so let's make it generic so that it can run all the test file.

```ssh
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha tests/**/test.js
```
So here we are asking mocha to run every file inside the folder test which has **test.js** in their filename.

### Running test via npm

This is a very easy step, all you need to do is just add below snippet inside script field of your package.json
`"test": "./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha tests/**/*test.js --reporter spec"`

This is how it looks in package.json
```ssh
"scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "start": "node .",
    "posttest": "npm run lint && nsp check",
    "test": "./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha tests/**/*test.js --reporter spec"
  },
```

Q. What is the advantage of creating new script in package.json

Ans. The advantage of creating test script above is that we can now run test by simply typing `npm test` in our terminal.
