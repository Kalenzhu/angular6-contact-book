## Installing libraries

#### Mocha

 **Mocha** is a JavaScript test framework for Node.js. For more details and documentation check its [Github repo](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
   To install mocha check below cmd:
   ```ssh
   npm install mocha --save-dev
   ```

#### Chai
 **Chai** is an assertion library, similar to Node's build in assert. It makes testing much easier by giving you lots of assertions you can run against your code.
 For more details and documentation check its [Github repo](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).
To install mocha check below cmd:
   ```ssh
   npm install chai --save-dev
   ```

#### Chai-http
 **Chai-http** is a js library which helps you make HTTP request using chai.
 For more details and documentation check its [Github repo](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-http).
To install mocha check below cmd:
   ```ssh
   npm install chai-http --save-dev
   ```


## Setting up Testing for APIs

#### Creating new Data source for test

We are going to create a new data source for test so that testing does not impact the **Production Data**.

- Copy the **datasources.json** file under server folder and paste it under same folder and rename it as **datasources.test.json**.

- Open the **datasources.test.json** file and rename **data.json** to **test-data.json** mentioned in file field.

Before
```ssh
"fileSystem": {
    "name": "fileSystem",
    "localStorage": "",
    "file": "data/data.json",
    "connector": "memory"
  }
```

After
```ssh
"fileSystem": {
    "name": "fileSystem",
    "localStorage": "",
    "file": "data/test-data.json",
    "connector": "memory"
  }
```

Q. What's the use of creating **datasources.test.json** ?

Ans. Whenever we start loopback server after setting `NODE_ENV=test` our models will now use datasource mentioned in **datasources.test.json** instead of using datasources from **datasources.json**.
So the file path mentioned in **datasources.test.json** is *data/test-data.json*, hence our models will use *test-data.json* file instead of using *data.json*,
therefore our **production data** which is present in *data.json* will not be impacted while testing.
